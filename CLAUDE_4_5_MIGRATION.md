# Claude 4.5 Migration Guide

## Overview
This project has been updated to support Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 models, providing enhanced intelligence, better performance, and new features.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Model Updates
- **Added Claude Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
  - Max tokens: 16,000 (increased from 8,000)
  - Most intelligent model with best-in-class reasoning
  
- **Added Claude Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
  - Max tokens: 64,000 (significantly increased)
  - Fastest model with near-frontier performance

### 2. Package Updates
- Updated `@ai-sdk/anthropic` to `^1.0.0`
- Updated `ai` SDK to `^4.0.20`
- Updated other AI SDK providers to `^1.0.0` for consistency

### 3. Breaking Changes Handled

#### Sampling Parameters
- The system now properly handles the restriction that you cannot use both `temperature` and `top_p` together
- Default configuration uses only one parameter as required by Claude 4.5

#### Refusal Stop Reason
- Added handling for the new `refusal` stop reason
- When the model refuses to generate a response, users receive a clear error message
- Located in: `app/routes/api.chat.ts`

### 4. New Features

#### Extended Thinking (Optional)
- Added support for extended thinking mode for complex reasoning tasks
- Can be enabled by passing `enableExtendedThinking: true` in the chat request
- Automatically configures appropriate token budgets:
  - Sonnet 4.5: 10,000 thinking tokens
  - Haiku 4.5: 5,000 thinking tokens
- Located in: `app/lib/.server/llm/stream-text.ts`

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure API Key
Ensure you have a valid Anthropic API key configured in your environment or through the API Key Manager.

### 3. Test Claude 4.5 Models
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the application and navigate to the model selector

3. Select either:
   - "Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Sep 2025)" for maximum intelligence
   - "Claude Haiku 4.5 (Oct 2025)" for fastest responses

4. Test various prompts to verify:
   - Basic text generation works
   - Complex reasoning tasks perform better
   - Refusal handling works properly (try inappropriate requests)
   - Extended thinking improves complex task performance

### 4. Enable Extended Thinking (Optional)
To test extended thinking:
1. The feature can be enabled programmatically by modifying the chat request
2. Best for complex coding, reasoning, or analysis tasks
3. Note: This impacts prompt caching efficiency

## Model Selection Guide

### Choose Claude Sonnet 4.5 for:
- Complex reasoning and analysis
- Long-running autonomous agents
- Advanced coding tasks
- Large context workflows
- Tasks requiring maximum capability

### Choose Claude Haiku 4.5 for:
- Real-time applications
- High-volume intelligent processing
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Sub-agent architectures
- Tasks requiring speed with good intelligence

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Model not appearing in selector
- Ensure packages are updated: `npm install`
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: "Cannot use both temperature and top_p" error
- This is already handled in the code
- If you're setting custom parameters, use only one

### Issue: Refusal errors
- This is expected behavior when the model refuses inappropriate requests
- The error is properly handled and displayed to users

## Files Modified

1. `app/lib/modules/llm/providers/anthropic.ts` - Added Claude 4.5 models
2. `app/routes/api.chat.ts` - Added refusal handling and extended thinking support
3. `app/lib/.server/llm/stream-text.ts` - Added extended thinking configuration
4. `package.json` - Updated AI SDK dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Monitor model performance and user feedback
2. Adjust extended thinking token budgets based on usage patterns
3. Consider implementing model-specific prompt optimizations
4. Update documentation for end users
